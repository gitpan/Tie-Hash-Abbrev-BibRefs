This is the README file for Tie::Hash::Abbrev::BibRefs,
by Martin H. Sluka <martin@sluka.de>.

This module is an attempt to ease the mapping of often
abbreviated bibliographical references to the original titles.

To achieve this, it simplyfies the title according to
parameterizable rules and stores it as a "normalized key".

When accessing the hash, the key given is also "normalized" and
compared to the normalized version of the original title.
In addition, each word (words are separated by whitespace) may be
abbreviated by specifying only the first few letters.

If more than one matching hash entry is found, the values of all
matching entries are compared; as long as they are all equal (or
all undef, the lookup is still considered to be successful.
